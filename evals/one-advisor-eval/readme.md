How well does it perform its role? 

Does it stay in character? 

How quickly does the advisor create clarity about what the problem is? 

Five advisors: 

1. Architectural Theorist
2. Problem Definer
3. Somatic Coach
4. Team Leader
5. Harsh Critic

Use the playground.

The start:
Here's a plan I've made for a magazine I'd like to create with a friend:

Bicycle: Patterns for the Psychogenic Era
Bicycle is a quarterly print and digital magazine of blueprints for the AI era. One way of thinking about it is as a magazine of criticism for an art form, and a culture, that does not yet exist. Another way to think about it is as a magazine about interface design, in all the potential meanings of that term.
It combines elements of the Whole Earth Catalog, early Wired, Erowid, and early video game magazines.
Interest Cloud
Human-computer interaction, nondual meditation, finite & infinite games, AI alignment, American pragmatism, psychogenic design, Pochinko clowning, decentralized education, modern rituals, life-affirming spiritual practice, Christopher Alexander, taking children seriously, taking play seriously,  weird parties, social fabric, embodied computing, cognitive prosthetics, cyborgism, the early East Coast psychedelics scene, Marshall McLuhan, Jacques Tati, memetics, horror, Kegan stages, David Chapman, Stewart Brand, Dynamicland, small group aesthetics, cultural evolution, experience design, road trips, high weirdness, etc. etc. etc.
Magazine Sections
The magazine could have the following "rubrics," or sections:
"Demos"
Games, apps, interfaces. Compare to the demo disc that used to come with video game magazines. These are experimental protocols that push interaction—human-computer or human-human or human-other—in novel directions.
Over time and with funding, Bicycle can provide increasing editorial support for developing projects, using best practices in LLM evals. Contributors benefit both from distribution and from a process that improves their work. 
"Lifeforms"
Critical appreciations, disappreciations, recommendations, and phenomenological reports—happenings, immersive theater, clown shows, sadhanas, the weird phenomenological effects of prolonged LLM use, paeans to dying industries. The focus here is on what is coming into being, and what is going out of being. Holding beauty before it dies, touching something nascent before it becomes form. Energetic field readings. Culture reporting. Ideally lots of photographs paired with the essays.
"Manual"
Practical section, teach the reader how to do something. How do I run an LLM on my phone, and why would I want to? How can I create an info agent to filter my information sources? What's an MCP server and why should I care? How do I make the most of a solo MDMA trip? Etc. Compare to sections of the Whole Earth Catalog.
“Voices”
Interviews with inspiring people. Compare to The Paris Review interviews with poets and writers. Carefully conducted, edited, deeper and more careful than a podcast conversation. People who come to mind:
Stewart Brand
Alan Kay
Bret Victor
Charlie Awbery
David Chapman
Misha Glouberman
John Vervaeke
The Folk Computing guys
"Outputs"
Interesting artifacts of stochastic computing. Fleeting, ephemeral, recontextualized. Compare to Harper's Magazine's "Readings" section. Jailbreaks, machine poetry, snippets of dialogue. 
Features
The heart of the magazine. Likely mostly cultural criticism, reporting, and science writing, but the gates are wide for now. Example essays we have in mind:
Considering Stewart Brand's impact on the culture and his relevance to this moment, with an emphasis on the New Games Movement
The practice and significance of LLM evals as the site where human agency interacts with powerful AI systems
Essay examining the recent resurgence of clowning in American urban culture, its possible relationship to cultural atomism & predictions of neofeudalism
Nathan Fielder's The Rehearsal as a case study in David Chapman's meta-rationalism
The historical lineage behind Folk Computing (Dynamicland etc.), the promise of embodied computing, and why does it keep not happening
David Allen's Getting Things Done as a system for bootstrapping Kegan stage development
Someone should probably synthesize Tibetan Buddhist demonology with vasocomputation with reports that Internal Family Systems practitioners tend to converge on the view that demons (parts that actually hate you & are evil) are ontologically real
Book Reviews
We may want them.
Fiction
Science fiction or fiction that treats our present moment as science fiction or weird fiction. Probably not a core section, might come in later issues. AI-generated fiction a possibility here. No autofiction allowed.

Tell me what you think about it. 


How I want to feel:
- Ongoingly in every turn: getting perspectives I wouldn't have thought of alone. Surprisal. Challenged. Like I want to go back to the project and do more with it. 
- At the end: There's nothing else for me to learn from talking to this advisor. 


Put two realistic user inputs in a spreadsheet.

Two tabs:

1. The blessed set of prompts
2. Cool future ideas

Aiming for a merged system prompt from these.
