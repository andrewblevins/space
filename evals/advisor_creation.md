# Advisor Creation Journey

## Goals

- Enable users to generate AI advisors within minutes
- Help the user create advisors that are sufficiently differentiated in their approaches, values, and thinking styles
- Create a balanced panel of advisors that can illuminate different aspects of a problem

## Non-goals

- Creating advisors that give harmful, unethical, or dangerous advice
- Creating advisors that are merely slight variations of each other (this is okay if the user wants it, but the system should consistently nudge against it)

## User State at Start

The user feels curious but potentially uncertain about what perspectives would be most helpful for their situation. They may have some ideas about what kinds of advisors they want but need guidance on articulating specific perspectives.

## User State at End

The user feels confident that they have assembled a diverse panel of advisors that will provide meaningfully different angles on their situation. They understand the perspective each advisor brings and feel a sense of positive anticipation about engaging with them.

## Constraints on Advisor Creation

- Each advisor must have a clearly defined perspective, background, or thinking style
- Each advisor description should be more than 100 words to ensure sufficient detail
- System should nudge the user to revise advisor descriptions that are too vague or too similar to currently active advisors

## Quality Metrics for Advisor Creation

- Frequency with which user accepts generated advisors without revision
- Number of completed rounds with generated advisors

## Advisor Creation Sub-Journeys

The Advisor Creation journey can be broken down into three distinct sub-journeys:
