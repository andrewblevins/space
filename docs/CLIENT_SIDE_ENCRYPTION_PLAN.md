# Client-Side Encryption Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of client-side encryption for SPACE Terminal conversations. The goal is to encrypt conversation data before it reaches our servers, ensuring that administrators cannot access user conversation content while maintaining full functionality.

## Privacy Scope and Limitations

### What Gets Protected
- Conversation content stored on our servers
- Conversation titles and metadata
- Advisor descriptions and configurations
- Voting questions and debate records
- Protection against our database breaches or admin access

### What Remains Shared
- **All conversation content still goes to Anthropic (Claude) and OpenAI (ChatGPT) APIs in plaintext**
- AI providers can still see, process, and potentially store all messages
- This encryption protects against SPACE Terminal access, not AI provider access

### Honest Value Proposition
"Your conversations are encrypted on our servers so we cannot access them. However, messages are still processed by Claude and ChatGPT APIs for AI responses. This minimizes your data footprint while providing powerful AI capabilities."

## Technical Architecture

### Encryption Key Management
```javascript
// 1. Derive encryption key from user's Google OAuth token
const deriveUserKey = async (googleToken) => {
  const keyMaterial = await crypto.subtle.importKey(
    'raw',
    new TextEncoder().encode(googleToken + 'SPACE_SALT'),
    { name: 'PBKDF2' },
    false,
    ['deriveKey']
  );
  
  return await crypto.subtle.deriveKey(
    {
      name: 'PBKDF2',
      salt: new TextEncoder().encode('SPACE_ENCRYPTION_SALT'),
      iterations: 100000,
      hash: 'SHA-256'
    },
    keyMaterial,
    { name: 'AES-GCM', length: 256 },
    false,
    ['encrypt', 'decrypt']
  );
};

// 2. Store key in browser session (not localStorage for security)
let userEncryptionKey = null;
```

### Data Encryption Functions
```javascript
// Encrypt data before sending to server
const encryptData = async (plaintext, key) => {
  const iv = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(12));
  const encoded = new TextEncoder().encode(plaintext);
  
  const encrypted = await crypto.subtle.encrypt(
    { name: 'AES-GCM', iv },
    key,
    encoded
  );
  
  return {
    encrypted: Array.from(new Uint8Array(encrypted)),
    iv: Array.from(iv)
  };
};

// Decrypt data received from server
const decryptData = async (encryptedData, key) => {
  const encrypted = new Uint8Array(encryptedData.encrypted);
  const iv = new Uint8Array(encryptedData.iv);
  
  const decrypted = await crypto.subtle.decrypt(
    { name: 'AES-GCM', iv },
    key,
    encrypted
  );
  
  return new TextDecoder().decode(decrypted);
};
```

## Database Schema Changes

### Current Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE conversations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  title TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  metadata JSONB
);

CREATE TABLE messages (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  conversation_id UUID REFERENCES conversations(id),
  type TEXT NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  metadata JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);
```

### Encrypted Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE conversations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  encrypted_title JSONB, -- {encrypted: [...], iv: [...]}
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  metadata JSONB, -- Non-sensitive metadata only
  -- Analytics-friendly unencrypted fields
  message_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  last_activity TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);

CREATE TABLE messages (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  conversation_id UUID REFERENCES conversations(id),
  type TEXT NOT NULL, -- Keep for basic functionality
  encrypted_content JSONB, -- {encrypted: [...], iv: [...]}
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  -- Analytics-friendly unencrypted fields
  token_count INTEGER,
  processing_time_ms INTEGER
);
```

## Security Considerations

### Key Management
- **Derive keys from OAuth tokens** to ensure they're user-specific
- **Store keys in memory only** during session (not localStorage)
- **Regenerate keys on login** to ensure fresh encryption per session

### Browser Compatibility
- **Use Web Crypto API** (supported in all modern browsers)
- **Feature detection** and graceful fallback for unsupported browsers
- **Progressive enhancement** - app works without encryption if crypto unavailable

### Error Recovery
- **Corruption detection** - verify data integrity after decryption
- **Fallback storage** - option to store unencrypted if encryption fails
- **User notification** - clear errors if encryption/decryption fails

## Analytics Impact

### What We Can Still Track
- **User engagement** - login frequency, session duration
- **Feature usage** - messages sent, advisors created, votes cast
- **Performance metrics** - response times, error rates
- **Growth metrics** - new users, retention, usage patterns

### What We Lose
- **Content analysis** - cannot analyze conversation topics or sentiment
- **AI debugging** - cannot read conversations to debug AI issues
- **Content search** - cannot implement server-side conversation search

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Client-side analytics** - analyze content in browser, send aggregated stats only
- **Error metadata** - collect error information without conversation content
- **User surveys** - gather feedback through other channels

## Privacy Policy Updates

### New Section: Data Encryption
```markdown
## Client-Side Encryption

SPACE Terminal encrypts your conversation data on your device before storing it on our servers. This means:

- **We cannot read your conversation content** - it's encrypted before reaching our servers
- **Your conversations are protected** from database breaches or admin access
- **AI processing remains unaffected** - messages are still sent to Claude and ChatGPT APIs for responses
- **Cross-device sync works normally** - encrypted data synchronizes across your devices

### What This Protects
- Conversation content stored on our servers
- Conversation titles and metadata
- Advisor configurations and voting data

### What This Doesn't Protect
- **AI API processing** - your messages are still processed by Anthropic and OpenAI
- **Browser storage** - conversations are decrypted in your browser for display
- **Export files** - exported data includes unencrypted content for portability

### Technical Details
- Encryption uses AES-256-GCM with keys derived from your authentication
- Keys are generated fresh each session and never stored on our servers
- Only you can decrypt your conversation data
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Encryption/decryption function tests
- [ ] Key derivation tests
- [ ] Error handling tests

### Integration Tests
- [ ] End-to-end conversation flow with encryption
- [ ] Cross-device sync with encrypted data
- [ ] Migration from unencrypted to encrypted storage

### User Testing
- [ ] Performance impact assessment
- [ ] User experience with encryption indicators
- [ ] Recovery from encryption failures

## Rollout Plan

### Development Phase (Week 1)
- Implement basic encryption on development branch
- Test with sample data
- Verify no impact on AI functionality

### Beta Phase (Week 2)
- Deploy to staging environment
- Test with volunteer users
