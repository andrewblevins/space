# SPACE Terminal - Evaluation Loop Implementation Plan

## üéØ Current Status: Phase 5 Complete (Ready for Testing)
**Completed**: Phases 1-5 (JSON format, Gemini integration, Assertions system, Evaluations system, Optimization MVP)  
**Next Up**: Testing and refinement  
**Branch**: `feature/eval-loop` (ready to merge full evaluation + optimization system)

## Overview
Implement an evaluation and optimization loop for advisor responses, allowing users to define assertions, run evaluations, and automatically optimize prompts to meet those assertions.

## Architecture Goals
1. Allow users to create assertions about advisor responses
2. Evaluate responses against assertions using Gemini 2.5 Flash-lite
3. Automatically optimize advisor/system prompts to pass evaluations
4. Store full conversation context for reproducibility
5. Track evaluation and optimization history

## Phase 1: JSON Refactor for Advisor Responses ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Current State
- Single message contains multiple advisor perspectives with `[ADVISOR: Name]` markers
- Difficult to attach assertions to individual advisor responses
- Text-based parsing required for separation

### Target State
```json
{
  "type": "advisor_response",
  "advisors": [
    {
      "id": "resp-carl-jung-1737914400123",
      "name": "Carl Jung",
      "response": "From an analytical psychology perspective...",
      "timestamp": "2025-01-26T12:00:00.123Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "resp-marie-curie-1737914400456", 
      "name": "Marie Curie",
      "response": "From a scientific methodology standpoint...",
      "timestamp": "2025-01-26T12:00:00.456Z"
    }
  ],
  "synthesis": "Bringing these perspectives together..."
}
```

### Implementation Steps ‚úÖ COMPLETED
1. ‚úÖ Update system prompt to request JSON output
2. ‚úÖ Modify `useClaude` hook to detect and parse JSON responses
3. ‚úÖ Create `AdvisorResponseCard` component with assertion button
4. ‚úÖ Update message rendering to handle both formats (backwards compatibility)

## Phase 2: Gemini 2.5 Flash-lite Integration ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### API Setup
- Model: `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` (8192 token context)
- Pricing: Free tier available, then $0.01/$0.04 per million tokens
- Use cases: Assertions evaluation, prompt optimization

### Implementation ‚úÖ COMPLETED
1. ‚úÖ Add Gemini API key to environment variables
2. ‚úÖ Create `useGemini` hook for API calls
3. ‚úÖ Add key management in settings (similar to OpenAI)

## Phase 3: Assertions System ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Data Structure
```javascript
// Storage: localStorage key pattern: space_assertions_<responseId>
{
  responseId: "resp-carl-jung-1737914400123",
  responseContent: "From an analytical psychology perspective...",
  advisorName: "Carl Jung",
  conversationContext: {
    messages: [...], // Full conversation history
    advisors: [...], // Active advisors configuration
    systemPrompt: "...", // System prompt at time of response
    timestamp: "2025-01-26T12:00:00.123Z"
  },
  assertions: [
    {
      id: "assert-1",
      text: "Response should mention unconscious patterns",
      createdAt: "2025-01-26T12:01:00.000Z"
    },
    {
      id: "assert-2", 
      text: "Response should relate to collective unconscious",
      createdAt: "2025-01-26T12:01:30.000Z"
    }
  ],
  evaluations: [], // Will be populated by eval runs
  optimizations: [] // Will be populated by optimization runs
}
```

### UI Components ‚úÖ COMPLETED
1. ‚úÖ **Assertion Button**: Small icon next to each advisor response
2. ‚úÖ **Assertions Modal**: Text area for entering multiple assertions
3. ‚úÖ **Save Logic**: Store assertions with full context

## Phase 4: Evaluations System ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Evaluation Process ‚úÖ COMPLETED
1. ‚úÖ User clicks "Evaluate" in Evaluations modal
2. ‚úÖ Send single batch request to Gemini with:
   - The advisor response
   - All assertions to evaluate
   - Request JSON response with pass/fail for each
3. ‚úÖ Parse results and store with timestamp

### Evaluation Prompt Template
```
Evaluate whether this AI advisor's response meets the following assertions.

Response:
[ADVISOR RESPONSE]

Assertions:
1. [ASSERTION 1]
2. [ASSERTION 2]
3. [ASSERTION 3]

Return your evaluation as JSON in this exact format:
{
  "results": [
    {"id": 1, "pass": true, "reason": "Response discusses shadow and personal unconscious"},
    {"id": 2, "pass": false, "reason": "No mention of collective unconscious"},
    {"id": 3, "pass": true, "reason": "Includes dream analysis example"}
  ]
}
```

### Storage Structure
```javascript
evaluations: [
  {
    id: "eval-1",
    timestamp: "2025-01-26T12:05:00.000Z",
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash-lite",
    results: [
      {
        assertionId: "assert-1",
        assertionIndex: 1,
        passed: true,
        reason: "Response discusses shadow and personal unconscious patterns"
      },
      {
        assertionId: "assert-2",
        assertionIndex: 2,
        passed: false,
        reason: "No mention of collective unconscious or archetypes"
      }
    ],
    overallPassed: false,
    batchRequest: true  // Indicates this used batch evaluation
  }
]
```

## Phase 5: Optimization Loop (MVP) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### MVP Optimization Strategy
1. **Advisor-only optimization** (skip system prompt for MVP)
2. **Simple progress feedback** - spinner with iteration count
3. **Background processing** - run all 10 iterations without user intervention
4. **Binary decision** - accept optimized prompt or keep original
5. **Best attempt on failure** - present best result if no perfect solution found

### Optimization Process (MVP)
1. User clicks "Optimize" in Evaluations modal
2. Simple modal: "Optimize [Advisor Name]?" with Start button
3. Progress: "Optimizing prompts... (3/10)" with cancel option
4. For each iteration (up to 10):
   - Use Gemini to suggest improved advisor prompt
   - Test with Claude using original conversation context
   - Evaluate against assertions
   - Keep best result, continue if not perfect
5. Present results: "Improved X/Y assertions" with before/after prompts
6. User chooses: Accept or Cancel

### Optimization Prompt Template (MVP)
```
Current advisor prompt for [ADVISOR_NAME]:
[CURRENT PROMPT]

This advisor's response failed these assertions:
[FAILED ASSERTIONS WITH REASONS]

The original response was:
[ADVISOR RESPONSE]

Suggest an improved advisor prompt that would help produce responses meeting all assertions. Keep the same expertise level and personality, just enhance the approach.

Improved prompt:
```

### Storage Structure (MVP)
```javascript
// Add to existing assertions data structure
optimizations: [
  {
    id: "opt-1",
    startedAt: "2025-01-26T12:10:00.000Z",
    completedAt: "2025-01-26T12:15:00.000Z",
    originalPrompt: "Analytical psychologist...",
    finalPrompt: "Analytical psychologist who explores both personal and collective unconscious...",
    success: true,  // All assertions passed
    totalIterations: 3,
    improvementCount: 2, // How many assertions improved
    totalAssertions: 3
  }
]
```

### Implementation (MVP)
1. **Single component**: Extend `EvaluationsModal` with optimization logic
2. **No new hooks**: Add `handleOptimize` function directly
3. **Simple UI**: Basic modal overlay for progress and results
4. **Core logic**: 10-iteration loop with Gemini + Claude + evaluation

## Phase 6: UI Implementation ‚úÖ PARTIALLY COMPLETED

### New Components ‚úÖ COMPLETED
1. ‚úÖ **AssertionsModal**: Create/view assertions for a response
2. ‚úÖ **EvaluationsModal**: List responses with assertions, run evals
3. ‚úÖ **EvaluationResultsModal**: Show eval results (basic version)
4. ‚è≥ **Optimization UI**: Simple modal overlay within EvaluationsModal (MVP approach)

### AccordionMenu Addition ‚úÖ COMPLETED
```javascript
{
  id: 'evaluations',
  label: 'Evaluations',
  onClick: onEvaluationsClick,
  icon: (/* checklist icon */)
}
```

## Implementation Order
1. ‚úÖ JSON refactor for advisor responses
2. ‚úÖ Gemini API integration
3. ‚úÖ Assertions UI and storage
4. ‚úÖ Evaluations button and modal
5. ‚úÖ Basic evaluation functionality
6. ‚úÖ Optimization loop (MVP implementation)
7. ‚è≥ Prompt update mechanism (basic version implemented, needs integration with main advisor state)

## Success Metrics
- Clean separation of advisor responses
- Reliable assertion evaluation
- Successful prompt optimization within 10 iterations
- Full context preservation for reproducibility
- Intuitive UI flow

## Technical Considerations
- Backwards compatibility with existing message format
- Efficient storage of conversation contexts
- Rate limiting for Gemini API calls
- Error handling for failed evaluations
- Rollback mechanism for prompt changes
