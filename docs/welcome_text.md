SPACE v0.2.6

Change Your Minds

SPACE is an interface for exploring complex questions with multiple AI perspectives at once. Instead of one voice from a single AI assistant, each of your messages generates a multiplicity of simultaneous responses—each from a distinct perspective.

Features:

- Multiple perspectives respond in parallel for direct comparison
- Journal onboarding surfaces rich context before conversation begins
- Generate, swap, and create perspectives freely as the conversation evolves
- Reference previous discussions in chat with @-mentions
- Track and search based on topic with automatic knowledge tags
- Full transparency—see exactly what's sent to AI models in Debug mode

SPACE is currently in beta.
