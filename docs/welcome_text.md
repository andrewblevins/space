SPACE v0.2.4

Change Your Minds

SPACE is a terminal interface for navigating complex situations with multiple AI advisors. Instead of getting one perspective from a single AI assistant, you create constellations of advisorsâ€”each with their own expertise, viewpoint, or lineage.

Features: 

- Generate and swap high-quality advisors instantly
- Reference previous discussions in chat
- Automated advisor recommendations in the side panel
- Track and search based on topic with automatic knowledge tags
- Metaphor tracking makes the structure of thought visible
- Test advisor responses with assertions and evaluations

SPACE is currently in beta.
