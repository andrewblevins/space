UX: 

- Give the agents search abilities. 

- Is there a way to limit the length of responses more elegantly? Does the current system actually do anything?

- File uploading should be easier and more automatic, e.g. texts pasted in over a certain word count should become attachments. 

- Wants an equivalent to "projects" in other chat interfaces.

- Right now the system is not good at handling when advisors change. Advisors are too sticky. I'm not sure how to fix this. Could try just more emphatic prompting.

- Voice? 

Bugs:

- Text streaming in conversations gets progressively slower over the length of a conversation. 

- When two advisors in the list have the same name, deactivating one seems to activate the other. We can fix this by not allowing two advisors with the same name.
