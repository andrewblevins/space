# Advisor Categories

While users can create any advisors they find helpful, common patterns include:

## Domain Experts
- Industry specialists with deep knowledge
- Technical experts for specific technologies
- Regulatory and compliance advisors
- Market analysts and researchers

## Stakeholder Representatives  
- Customer personas and user archetypes
- Team member perspectives
- Investor or board viewpoints
- Partner and vendor considerations

## Strategic Thinkers
- Devil's advocates and challengers
- Big picture visionaries
- Risk assessors and scenario planners
- Innovation catalysts

## Process Facilitators
- Synthesizers who integrate multiple views
- Prioritizers who rank options
- Summarizers who distill key points
- Decision documenters who track rationale

## Experience-Based Advisors
- People who've failed at similar ventures
- Success story representatives
- Cross-industry pattern recognizers
- Historical perspective providers

The system should not enforce these categories but recognize when users are building comprehensive advisory ecosystems and support their organization efforts.
