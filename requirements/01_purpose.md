# Purpose

## Purpose of This Document

This document outlines the product requirements for SPACE Terminal. It is specifically geared toward providing the level of specificity needed to begin writing useful evals for the product, but could also be used as a general guide to creating v0 of the product. 

A few aspirational features are also described, marked "non-MVP" where they appear.

## Core User Problem & Solution

Users come to SPACE when experiencing cognitive or emotional constriction - they feel stuck between limited options, overwhelmed by complexity, unable to integrate conflicting perspectives on a situation.

The key user need is to expand their mental space beyond what a single perspective (their own or a standard AI assistant's) can provide.

SPACE solves this by facilitating conversations with multiple AI advisors that:

1. Offer a set of well-balanced and genuinely distinct perspectives
2. Hold the relevant details of the situation in memory
3. Illuminate possibilities or patterns the user would not have considered on their own

## Non-goals

- SPACE is not designed to be addictive, in fact we want to take measures to prevent compulsive use of the app and steer the user toward leaving it when they achieve completion on their problem.
- SPACE is not really for finding information, in the traditional sense. It won't search the internet, for instance, find primary sources, or perform deep research. It is a relatively closed container.
- SPACE is not for people who are looking to have the process of selecting and prompting their advisors happen completely behind the scenes. It invites the user to take responsibility for the entities they are talking to.
- SPACE is not designed to deal with clinical levels of confusion and overwhelm. For people incapable of differentiating virtual entities from real ones, it could be actively dangerous.
- SPACE is not designed to work with image or video generation.
