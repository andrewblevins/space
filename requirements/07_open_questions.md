# Open Questions

A list of random thoughts/questions that pop up as we iterate on this doc. We'll post tentative answers as we iterate on this doc.

- How can we meaningfully define and measure sycophancy?
- To what extent should context setting and exploration be treated as distinct, both in the user flow and in the metrics we're using?
