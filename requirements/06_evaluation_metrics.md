# High-Level Evaluation Metrics

To track the overall health of the product and its value to users, we will measure:

- **Conversation Length**: Number of user turns per conversation
- **Sentiment Markers**: Frequency of value acknowledgment phrases ("that's helpful," "I see now"), signaling moments of genuine insight
- **Conversations Per User**: Total conversation threads initiated, revealing if users find value across multiple situations
- **Return Sessions**: Count of distinct days with active usage, showing ongoing utility in users' lives
- **Return Frequency**: Average time between return visits, indicating how SPACE fits into users' natural rhythm of seeking clarity

We will also count:

- Instances of specific value acknowledgments (e.g., "that's helpful," "I hadn't considered that")
- Level of productive challenge (were difficult perspectives offered?)
- Evidence of new connections or insights in user responses
- Instances of sycophantic patterns (excessive agreement without evidence)

We will also track metrics specific to decision-making use cases:
- Creation of specialized advisor categories (experts, stakeholders, facilitators)
- Average number of advisors created per conversation
- Frequency of users adding advisors mid-conversation
- Evidence of structured decision documentation in conversations
- Return rate for iterative decision refinement
