# Seed Prompts

SPACE Terminal will offer users a curated list of seed prompts to initiate meaningful conversations with their advisors.

## Types of Prompt Templates

The system will include an array of pre-written prompts, categorized, for instance (categories not fully set yet, but something like):

Business Strategy & Decisions
Personal Growth & Reflection  
Practical Problem-Solving
Relationship & Communication
Creative Exploration
Life Planning & Transitions

## Implementation Requirements

1. Each prompt template category should display in a pop-out accordion menu when the user clicks a "Saved Prompts" button.
2. Templates should be organized by category with 3-5 templates per category.
3. When selected, the template text should auto-populate the message input field, allowing the user to customize it before sending.
4. The system should track which templates are most frequently used and present those higher in the list over time.
5. Users should be able to save their own custom prompts to the template library for future use.

Example prompts should include:
- "I'm validating a business idea and need to test market fit"
- "Help me think through a complex hiring decision"
- "I'm planning a product launch and need diverse perspectives"
- "I need to prepare for a difficult conversation with my co-founder"
- "Help me process this career transition I'm facing"

The engineering team may expand this initial set of templates based on user testing, but should maintain the structure of offering prompts that encourage multi-perspective thinking and spaciousness.
