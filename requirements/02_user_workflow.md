# User Workflow

## Overall User Workflow

1. User creates an account or logs in with their credentials.
2. If it's their first time, they can go through an optional "worksheet" dialogue to receive recommended advisors based on their background and preferences.
3. Alternatively, the user can create custom advisors by clicking the + button and either:
    - Writing their own advisor description
    - Using AI assistance to generate a description from minimal input
4. The user starts a conversation by either:
    - Responding to the system's open-ended starter question
    - Writing their own custom prompt
    - Selecting a template from the seed prompt library
5. Advisors respond from their distinct perspectives, asking clarifying questions if needed.
6. The user engages in multi-perspective exploration with the advisors, with the system maintaining balanced participation from all advisors.
7. When the conversation reaches a natural endpoint, the system helps the user consolidate insights.
8. The user summarizes key takeaways and can save these insights for future reference.
9. The user can return to continue the same conversation thread later or start a new one with the same or different advisors.
