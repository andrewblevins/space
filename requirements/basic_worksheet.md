This worksheet is to help you surface information about yourself that will then be used to identify a compelling board AI of advisors. It might also be interesting for its own sake if you haven’t thought about these questions in a while. Our advice is, be honest and give the LLM plenty of material to work with. Feel free to skip any that don’t feel relevant - but the more information you give here the better your results will be.

When you’ve filled in this worksheet, paste it into a new LLM chat alongside the `advisor_search` prompt.

This is the BASIC version of the worksheet, for the time-limited.

1. Name up to three areas of your life and how you would like to work on them. (Example: Career - I want to start an interior design practice; Physical Health - I’d like to do a handstand; Personal - I’d like to create a warm and inviting home environment).

2. Name up to three real people, living or dead, who you find inspiring. What do you admire about each of them? 

3. Name up to three fictional characters you resonate with, and say what feels notable about each of them. 

4. Name up to three “viewquake books” that have helped shape your worldview.

5. Name any philosophical or wisdom traditions that you practice or are interested in.

6. Say three words about the type of person that you are interested in becoming or find inspiring.
