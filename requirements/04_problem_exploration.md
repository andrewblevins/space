# Problem Exploration Journey

## Goals

- Make clear the user's options in terms of starting the conversation (see 2.1 below for sub-journeys)
- Guide users from a state of cognitive constriction to expanded awareness and clarity
- Illuminate blind spots and unexamined assumptions
- Generate novel insights and possibilities that the user wouldn't reach on their own

## Non-goals

- Pushing users toward a single "correct" solution
- Merely making users feel better without genuine insight or "felt shifts" (in the sense meant by Eugene Gendlin in *Focusing*)
- Replacing professional therapy or advice in crisis situations

## User State at Start

The user feels stuck, overwhelmed, or caught between limited options. They experience physical tension, emotional discomfort, or mental looping around the same ideas. They may be frustrated by their inability to see a way forward.

User has their advisors selected and is looking at the conversation screen. They may feel uncertain how to begin or what to type.

## User State at End

The user feels a sense of spaciousness, clarity, and possibility. Their breathing is relaxed, their thinking is fluid, and they can see multiple promising paths forward. They have experienced an "insight cascade" where new connections and ideas began to flow naturally. They feel that this conversation has taken them somewhere "deep," that they would not have been able to get to without guidance and augmented perspective.

## Conversation Flow Constraints

- Each advisor should maintain a consistent voice and perspective aligned with their description
- Advisors should challenge the user's assumptions when that is what makes sense from their perspective
- Advisors should surface their own background only where directly relevant and useful (i.e. we want to avoid the "encyclopedia effect" that happens with real named people, where it seems like the LLM is trying to demonstrate its knowledge of the person rather than roleplaying them)
- Conversation should progress toward greater clarity rather than circular discussion
- (Non-MVP) System should detect when a perspective has been exhausted and suggest bringing in different advisors or changing current ones (see 1.4 above). 

## Quality Metrics for Problem Exploration

- Sentiment shift in user responses (from negative/constrained to positive/expansive)
- Presence of "insight markers" in user language ("I hadn't thought of that," "That's a new perspective," etc.)
- Conversation length, both in terms of turns taken and in terms of how often the user returns to the same conversation more than 2 hours since the last engagement
