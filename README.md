# SPACE Terminal

[SPACE Terminal](https://spaceterminal.xyz) is a terminal-style interface for personal discovery and thinking with large language models. SPACE stands for Simple Perspective-Augmenting Conversation Environment (or maybe, Simulated People Advising Convincingly Enough).

The biggest difference from other chat interfaces is the ability to create and manage AI personas with distinct perspectives, changing them out mid-conversation. For more about AI advisors, see the Insight Cascade process and guidelines here: https://github.com/andrewblevins/insight-cascade. 

SPACE also lets you have much longer conversations without hitting rate limits, a current limitation of Claude Pro.

The app uses Claude 4 Sonnet for the main conversation and GPT-4o for background analysis features like metaphor tracking and question generation (which you can activate by clicking the triangles next to those menus). Model selection is not configurable through the interface yet, if anyone wants to implement that I'd be very grateful.

Currently SPACE will only work well on a desktop or laptop computer. Mobile layout TK.

SPACE does not track or store any user data. Everything is saved in local browser storage. (You are, however, sending information to Anthropic and OpenAI, whose data policies are worth reviewing if this is a concern.)

*SPACE is one node in a larger project exploring frameworks and interfaces for using Large Language Models for personal and social discovery. If you're interested in being a part of a commmunity supporting ongoing dialogue and experimentation around this, sign up for updates here: https://forms.gle/svMNnjJjJdFUjQ9L8.*

## Setup

SPACE Terminal requires API keys from both Anthropic and OpenAI to function. You'll be prompted to insert them when you first run the app.

You'll also need to add some money to both accounts, or set up payment methods. For more on this, see [Cost Expectations](#cost-expectations) below.

### Quick Development Setup
For developers, run `npm run dev:setup` to automatically start the server and configure API keys from environment variables. See [AUTOMATION.md](docs/AUTOMATION.md) for details. 

### 1. Get Your API Keys

#### Anthropic (Claude)
1. Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Navigate to "API Keys" in your account settings
4. Create a new API key and copy it
5. Include the header `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01` in your requests to use Claude 4 Sonnet

#### OpenAI
1. Visit [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Go to "API Keys" in your account settings
4. Create a new API key and copy it

### Once that's done, to start playing

Add your first advisor by clicking the + button on the left side of the screen. Type in a name and click "Generate Description" to get a personality, edit to your liking, then click "Create". 

Make sure the advisors you want to talk to are green (selected).

When you have a board of advisors you like, enter:

> /prompt use "serious-play"

This will send a basic starting prompt for the conversation.

## Features

- **Terminal-Style Interface**: Clean, focused environment for conversation

- **Advisor System**: Create, manage, and generate descriptions for AI personas for varied perspectives

- **Column Layout**: 
  - Left: Metaphor tracking and advisor menu
  - Center: Main conversation area
  - Right: Generated questions for exploration

- **Context Management**: Set token limit beyond which conversation history is shortened (to save tokens/$$$). Past this limit, the LLM will receive the six most recent messages and any messages deemed relevant according to...

- **Tag Analysis**: Background analysis and tracking of conversation themes (currently only used for context management but will be expanded and deepened)

- **Export**: Save your conversation in markdown format

- **Prompts Library**: A library of prompts you can add to, edit, and delete. Also includes a handful of default suggestions

- **Capture**: Right click selected text to capture and save to a Markdown file

- **Debug**: Use the settings menu (gear icon, bottom-left) to toggle debug mode and see what's being sent to Claude plus estimated costs.

## Interface

SPACE has moved to a **fully GUI-based interface** for ease of use. All functionality is accessible through:

- **Settings Menu**: Click the gear icon (bottom-left) for debug mode, token limits, API key management
- **Advisors Panel**: Left sidebar for creating, editing, and selecting AI advisors  
- **Conversation**: Main terminal area for natural conversation
- **Export Menu**: Click export icon for saving conversations in markdown format
- **Prompts Library**: Access saved prompts through the interface

### Legacy Commands

Some terminal commands are still available for power users:
- `/new` - Start a new session  
- `/debug` - Toggle debug mode
- `/help` - Show available commands

*Note: Advisor sharing, group management, and most other features are now handled through the graphical interface rather than slash commands.*

## Roadmap

- [ ] Worksheet system for reflection and advisor finding
- [ ] Model selection and configuration 
- [ ] Better memory / context management system
- [ ] More conversation analysis tools (interpersonal patterns, Kegan stages, etc.?)
- [x] Advisor sharing through file import/export

## Cost Expectations

SPACE Terminal is very cost-effective to use. For instance, an hour-long deep discussion may run about $0.25-30 (possibly up to a dollar if you send messages very fast). Each message exchange (your message + AI response) costs roughly 2Â¢ on average. Starting with $5 in each API account will easily give you several hours of conversation. Use debug mode in the settings menu to monitor estimated costs in real-time.

SPACE Terminal would not be possible without the generous support of the Context Appreciation Society. 

## Security Note

SPACE Terminal encrypts API keys in your browser's localStorage to improve security. When you first enter your API keys, you'll be prompted to create a password. This password is used to encrypt your keys before they're stored and is only kept in-memory during your session. This significantly reduces the risk from malicious browser extensions that might try to extract your keys.

We're working on implementing a more secure server-side approach in an upcoming update.
